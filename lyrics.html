        [Intro]
(Mmm, mmm)
(We can make it work)
Yo, Kiwi, thank you, bro
Love hurts, love hurts
</pre>

<pre>
    [Chorus: Lil Tjay]
I know you feedin' off of what I started first
I see you postin', that just put me on alert
We can make it work, we can make it work
Love hurts, love hurts, love hurts
The way I'm feelin', I might get that nigga murked
Like how you gon' forget me? You was with me in the dirt
It might just take some time, I know that we can make it work
Baby, try it first (Love hurts, love hurts, love hurts)
</pre>
<pre>
    [Verse 1: Lil Tjay]
You somethin' different from the rest, that's why I fuck with you
Just know it's hard for me expressin' all my love for you
Kissin' you, touchin' you, way more than me fuckin' you
Don't nobody know me like you do, you make me comfortable
I tell you everything (Everything), where I been, who I'm with, no lies to you
Fuck these other bitches, I don't wanna keep my eyes on you
Wish I could give you everything, anything, anything
Put that on my mama, all I want for you is better things
You got my number, call my phone, I ain't gon' let it ring
If I could trust you, but my style would be in better team
Girl, you know I'm with you, hundred grand, try to understand
I'm a busy man (But baby girl, I thought we had a plan)
</pre>
<pre>
    [Chorus: Lil Tjay]
I know you feedin' off of what I started first
I see you postin', that just put me on alert
We can make it work, we can make it work
Love hurts, love hurts, love hurts
The way I'm feelin', I might get that nigga murked
How you gon' forget me? You was with me in the dirt
It might just take some time, I know that we can make it work
Baby, try it first (Love hurts, love hurts, love hurts)
